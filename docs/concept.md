# BATCH Concept

- **BATCH**

  - Multiple LOAF subsystems can be bridged together in a leader-worker configuration to form a local device cluster to coordinate multiple processes to perform some integrated complex process
  - This is referred to as **BATCH** which stands for _Bridging Architecture for Task Control & Handling_
  - **Example:** Multiple LOAFs (e.g., one for a mechanical shredder, one for a chemical reactor, and one for a bioreactor,) to create a plastic upcycling system that converts PET waste into edible microbial protein.
